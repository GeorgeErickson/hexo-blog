My friends often complain about trips to the liquor store. It’s cause most of them are (a) college students, (b) recent grads, or (c) young pros. And in Boston there are few parking spots, lots of crazy traffic, and no cargo bikes lying around to help carry 30-packs.

So what is DrinkIn?

- We have a site (and soon an app) that will deliver alcohol within an hour
- We have no delivery fee or minimum orders (who likes those anyways?)
- We use bicycles

Bikes? You heard it, bikes. We ran into this awesome [Monkeylectric Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minimonkey/monkey-light-pro-bicycle-wheel-display-system) and had an ‘aha’ moment. We’ll write more about this later, so stay tuned.

I believe that great teams, not great ideas, make successful companies. Our CTO, George Erickson, has been awesome at executing our vision. Also, Ernesto Reza has been our Mr. Do-It-All. So I like our chances. We started working on this in late April though, so bear with us as we get the site running full-speed ahead.

If you are interested, sign up for an account! If you are not in our delivery area, we’ll email you as soon as you are.

Also feel free to tell your friends, ‘Like’ us on Facebook or tweet about us.  And if you have any questions, just email me (pablo@drinkin.us). Can’t wait to hear what you think about it!
